Term,Interpretation,Good Value,Recommendations if Unfavorable
Dep. Variable,The dependent variable being predicted by the model.,The correct dependent variable,Ensure the correct variable is being predicted.
No. Observations,The total number of observations used in the model.,Depends on the data,Consider increasing the number of observations for more robust modeling.
Model,The SARIMAX model configuration including seasonal order.,Accurate model specification,Adjust model orders based on data seasonality and lag behavior.
Log Likelihood,Measures how likely the model is to have generated the observed data. Higher is better.,Higher values closer to 0,Re-evaluate model specification and adjust parameters or transformation to improve fit.
AIC (Akaike Information Criterion),Evaluates model fit with a penalty for the number of parameters. Lower values are better.,"Lower is better (e.g., AIC < 2000)",Reduce overfitting by simplifying the model.
BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion),Similar to AIC but with a larger penalty for more parameters. Lower is better.,"Lower is better (e.g., BIC < 2010)",Simplify the model or reduce the number of parameters to avoid overfitting.
HQIC (Hannan-Quinn Criterion),Another criterion for model selection. Lower values indicate a better model.,"Lower is better (e.g., HQIC < 2005)",Simplify the model or adjust seasonal components.
Covariance Type,Describes the method used to estimate the covariance matrix.,"Appropriate choice (e.g., 'opg' or 'robust')",Switch to a different covariance estimator or use 'robust' for heteroskedasticity.
Coefficient (coef),The coefficient of the parameter estimated by the model.,Coefficients in a reasonable range based on the domain,Review parameter significance or transform variables for better interpretability.
Standard Error (std err),The standard error of the estimated parameter. Smaller is better.,Smaller values (closer to 0),Smaller standard errors indicate more reliable coefficient estimates; consider improving model fit.
Z-Value (z),"The Z-value, which indicates the number of standard deviations the coefficient is from 0.",Values close to 0 (between -2 and 2),"If Z is too large or too small, it may indicate overestimation or underestimation; recheck parameter specification."
P-Value (P>|z|),P-Value for the significance of the Z-value. Should be lower than 0.05 for significance.,< 0.05 for statistical significance,"If P is too high, the variable may not be statistically significant; check for inclusion necessity."
Ljung-Box (Q),Tests if residuals are independent. Higher values indicate no autocorrelation.,> 0.05 indicates no autocorrelation,Increase the model complexity or use differencing to remove autocorrelation.
Jarque-Bera (JB),Test for normality of residuals. Lower values suggest residuals are normally distributed.,Values closer to 0 indicate normality,Consider transformations or add more data to reduce non-normality.
Heteroskedasticity (H),Measures the presence of heteroskedasticity in the residuals. Lower values indicate homoskedasticity.,Close to 1 for no heteroskedasticity,Consider using an ARCH/GARCH model to address heteroskedasticity.
Skew,Measures the asymmetry of the residuals. A value close to 0 is ideal.,Skew closer to 0 (between -0.5 and 0.5),Transform data or improve model specification to fix skew.
Kurtosis,Measures the peakedness or flatness of the residuals. A value around 3 is considered normal.,Kurtosis close to 3 is normal,"If kurtosis deviates significantly from 3, re-examine model assumptions or try alternative distributions."
