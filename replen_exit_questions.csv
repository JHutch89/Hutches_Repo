"I was so excited to get the email asking if I’d like to be part of this pilot. I am a long time Walmart+ member and Walmart is the only grocery store I purchase from. I was expecting the $150 gift card on June 28th after the 8 weeks of the pilot, per the sign up email. That day came and went, multiple calls to Walmart and multiple emails sent asking for the gift card with no help from anyone. I ended up speaking to 12 representatives, none of which knew what Replenishment was. I would highly suggest informing employees of pilots like this and have an easier way to get in touch with someone when customers have issues/questions. There needs to be a better process for sure.","If you already have a specific item in your cart, replenishment shouldn’t add another one. I didn’t realize this and ended up with two half gallons of milk.",No Reaction,It helps you get everything you normally would.

I don’t want to end up with items I may not need.
Love shopping Walmart and the delivery in home feature.,The replenishment automatically adds what I usually order and helps me greatly so that I don't forget to add those items.  It's great because it's saves me time in having to run and pick up things that I forgot to order.,Very Disappointed,Saves me time.,"It saves you time on the mundane, so you have time for the fun stuff.",I believe it's very helpful.,Creating and controlling my own Replenishment list,I like being able to review and add additional items that come up so that those items can be delivered at the same time.

"I am super happy with the pickup and delivery options. I love the InHome upgrade. I have found that many items are cheaper through Kroger delivery, but I know that's not what you're trying to learn about with this pilot. If Walmart offers price matching on grocery items, it would be nice to have a way to submit a price match request in app.     I also wish the app would easily let me add funds to an existing gift card. It's a convenient way to budget my groceries, but I don't like that I have to buy a new e-gift card. I'd love to be able to easily just top up the funds on an existing gift card that's in my Walmart Wallet.","I had to really pay attention to quantities. Some things it added multiples of and then I'd end up with 2+ of something I didn't need that many. It's very convenient and I love the idea of it, but maybe create an interface that makes it more intuitive to check quantities. An even better feature would be algorithm based where it could figure out how often I buy a certain product and only add that to my replenishment that often, so if on average I buy a product every 5 weeks then it would only be added to my cart every 5 weeks.",No Reaction,It's just a time saver. There are certain items that I buy with just about every order so it was nice to already have those in my cart.,"It saves you time on the mundane, so you have time for the fun stuff.","None, I covered it all. An algorithm based replenishment for items not purchased weekly would be nice.",Suggestions for how I can save by buying in bulk or switching brands,Auto delivery would be very inconvenient for me. It would just be something I'd have to remember to check every week. Sometimes I'm out of town or not at home or don't need certain things and I'd hate if they just automatically showed up. A couple years ago I didn't pay attention to my Amazon Subscribe and Save for a few months and I ended up with WAY too many of certain products because I forgot to skip those for the month.

Add only those items which user will buy anyway because users hate remove items from,Slightly Disappointed,I shop regularly and I like to have my cart prefilled with regular items so I spend less time adding them.,"It saves you time on the mundane, so you have time for the fun stuff.","I would say this is solid feature. I would improve accuracy of picks further, analyze patterns, apply machine learning.   One of the idea is to see list of replenishments with rules and be able modify them - just an idea. For example: blueberries, 2 count, every two weeks - modify or delete this rule.",Pre-booked delivery time,"I’m worried about accuracy at this point. I would like to have more experience with this feature to believe in picks it is doing.  I would suggest having settings - some users will choose auto delivery and some not, I would really like to have InHome delivery slots booking because sometime I forget to do it."

Keep innovating! I think the future is bright for this feature,So far replenishment has been a great experience and cut down on the amount of time needed to add some items. I think it would be good to have an option to set replenishment favorites so that things you must have are always included in each order.     This would make sure that my priority replenishment items are never missed.,Slightly Disappointed,The main benefit is the time savings that replenishment offers when creating an order.

Option to add replenishment favorites;     2. The option to add a replenishment frequency for individual items.

Nothing else. Keep up the good work!,Suggestions for how I can save by buying in bulk or switching brands,"I think auto delivery would be very beneficially and improve my experience greatly. It was my first selected choice but I changed my choice as I would rather prioritize saving money over auto delivery. Since I have a schedule/routine of when to order my groceries, auto delivery is not as important as being able to have replenishment save me money or suggest how to save money by comparing/switching brands."

Otherwise it is a very simple procedure,Pairing recipes with product suggestions,Sometimes you are still good on some items and I wouldn’t want to waste what we wouldn’t need at the time.
Great work!!,Replenishment has been a huge time saver! It's easy to start with the items it adds every week and then add/prune stuff from there.,Very Disappointed,"It saves me 15min a week picking out items I usually buy every week, which is huge given my free time is limited with young kids. It also makes ordering more convenient.","It saves you time on the mundane, so you have time for the fun stuff.",It would be nice to be able to add or remove things from Replenishment manually.,Creating and controlling my own Replenishment list,I like to have control over when I get my groceries.

N/A,Make the replenishment experience more like a subscription service where you can specify how often you would like to receive each individual item.,Slightly Disappointed,"The main benefit was that I didn't need to add the items that I typically purchased to the cart, they were already there waiting for me.","The ability to easily make changes to your picks, so you're in control of what you buy.","Replenishment is a great idea, although slightly clunky.

It was great,"I often find myself shopping “my items” on the Walmart app. This section should be “replenishment” and the items should be auto added to my cart, and I can go in that section to remove or add more.",Slightly Disappointed,Sometime I forget to order some regular items in our household.

Life is too fluid to jump into an automatic schedule for groceries.
"I hope you keep this feature.   I get that it’s similar to autoship and the differences are nuanced, but it is truly a better approach.   I hope you’re able to market and launch it in a way that brings you success.",Replenishment is the online shopping idea I have been waiting for.  It is the perfect blend of ai/technology and personal input.   I really appreciated how easy it made making my weekly shopping.,Very Disappointed,"Flexible collaboration.   Unlike auto subscriptions, replenishment gives you the flexibility to add or subtract to your order, adjusting for that week’s unique circumstances.   It starts your cart for you, but gives you the flexibility to make any adjustments necessary.","The ability to have a ""second you"" that knows what you need.",As the program progressed it seems the system got better at putting more items in the cart.   That was a major improvement.  Getting more suggestions was certainly better and added more value to the service than when I only received a handful of replenishment items.       One thought would be to be able to manually add a check mark next to an item to have it always be included in replenishment (even if it had not been ordered before).   Yet another angle on the flexible collaboration that makes replenishment a better service!,Creating and controlling my own Replenishment list,"My circumstances change.  I may have ordered too little or too much previously and prefer the flexibility of being able to collaborate on my order instead of autoship.      Most importantly, in order to not over order, I will ALWAYS limit what I auto ship."
"Overall the service is cool. For me it would not be beneficial if it’s an added expense, unless it would be bundled with the two services I already pay for.","The service is good in theory, but not good enough for an added expense. As I stated previously I would prefer to have my cart filled with more item, and remove them rather then searching and adding items I may need. After weeks of use, it’s not beneficial week after week. It added a few items but not enough.",No Reaction,"The main benefit is it added the main items for the most part, but not all the things I regularly pirchase","It saves you time on the mundane, so you have time for the fun stuff.","Overall I like the concept,  but I have not been able to just check out. I prefer to not have to search. Some things I buy weekly, or biweekly. Maybe the system can detect that.",Creating and controlling my own Replenishment list,"It would not improve because some of the items added I absolutely did not need. I buy coffee creamer and coffee regularly, and they were not added. I buy paper plates regularly, the same brand, and they were not added. I would end up still having to place another order.

"Shipt allows customers to leave small notes for items they are having delivered. For example, I want my bananas more green/yellow, or I want my avocado firm/semi-soft.

This was really fun and I appreciate the opportunity to try out a new service!,"I think that the Replenishment program is fine and saves time adding standard items to the cart each week.

Items that I don't order weekly, but do order regularly (like every 2 weeks or monthly items) were not included but those are the items I am more likely to forget shopping on my own.

I go through phases where a snack item is ordered weekly, but then I get bored with it and stop ordering it. It will still show up in the replenishment list weeks after I last ordered",Creating and controlling my own Replenishment list,I have had some issues with quantity of items being more than I need in a week so I wouldn't want to end up with 4 lbs of strawberries auto delivered to my home.   And items that are no longer ordered remain in the replenishment list after I no longer use them.   I do use Amazon Subscribe and Save and like it because it offers a discount for subscription items. I probably would not sign up for an auto delivery without a cost incentive.
I’ve been very pleased with the Walmart delivery service and the money and time it saves me. Thank you!!

I feel like that was a good rhythm in terms of how often to auto replenish. More would have felt like too much and any less frequent probably wouldn't have been soon enough. Most times my family orders at least one big grocery order once a week. With the sporadic couple of items here and there as well.,Other,There's honestly nothing we use that regularly that is on a consistent schedule that I'd want it auto delivered.

N/A,I think the selections you picked were not necessarily my weekly items. The list could have been much larger. For instance you suggested maybe $30 of items when I spend $200-250 weekly.

"I love the Walmart Plus program overall, specially the In-Home feature without the tips and dedicated delivery person.      Not related to Replenishment, but I would love to see more enhancements on the substitution feature:    Right now I have to remember every time to disable substitution if I don’t want other choices (or haven’t seen a way to do it permanently).  Otherwise, if I forget, the substitutions may not be what I would’ve picked.      Ideally, I would have substitutions disabled globally and then only enable it for the items I may consider other choices.  Moreover, I would like to have the ability to fine-tune a substitution with an entire set of items.  For example, right now if I have a gallon of milk in my cart, my only substitution preferences are a different brand of milk or a half-gallon of the same brand.  Ideally, I want two half-gallons of the same brand, but I can’t do that, so I’d rather not pick a substitution.

N/A,"I think the idea of auto-replenishment is good in theory but I found that I only used maybe 25% of the replenishment picks each week.
